# DRL-Behavioral-Cloning-Imitation-Learning

This repository contains implementations of imitation learning techniques, specifically behavioral cloning and DAgger (Dataset Aggregation), applied to the CarRacing-v2 environment.

## Overview

Imitation learning is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to perform tasks by observing expert demonstrations. This project focuses on using behavioral cloning and DAgger to train models that can effectively navigate the CarRacing-v2 environment.

## Files

- `main.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the main code for training and evaluating the model.
- `model.onnx`: The trained model in ONNX format.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:
   
bash git clone https://github.com/d3rar/DRL-Behavioral-Cloning-imitation-learning.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   
bash cd DRL-Behavioral-Cloning-imitation-learning

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   
bash jupyter notebook main.ipynb
